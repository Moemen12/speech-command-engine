The `speech-command-engine` package allows you to integrate voice commands into your web application. This package provides functions to start and stop voice recognition, as well as handle voice commands.

## Available Functions

- **Parameters**:
  - `config` (optional `VoiceRecognitionConfig`): Configuration options for the voice recognition process.

  import { startVoiceRecognition } from "speech-command-engine";

  startVoiceRecognition({
     autoStart:true

# Using `data-cmd` Attributes with `speech-command-engine`

To enable voice commands on specific elements in your web application, set a `data-cmd` attribute on any HTML element you want to control via voice. The value of this attribute should represent the action you want to trigger.

When the user says the predefined command followed by the value of the `data-cmd` attribute, the corresponding event or action will be executed.

## Example Usage

### HTML Setup

Hereâ€™s a practical example of how to set up elements with `data-cmd` attributes:

```html
<!-- When you say click on submit , this button will be clicked  -->
<button data-cmd="submit">Submit</button>

<!-- Here You should focus on the input or textarea u want by saying focus on {data-cmd value}
then fill out {anything u need to fill out with}

for the input below :

1-focus on email field
2-fill out hello world

  -->
<input type="email" data-cmd="email field" placeholder="Enter your email" />

```
